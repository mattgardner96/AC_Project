## Internet of Things A/C Controller
Code and documentation for a project I created over Summer 2018. By the end of the project, I had effectively designed a small Internet of Things device providing one-way control of my portable air conditioner. It's up and running, so I'm currently writing usage instructions and some project writeup information. The theory and implementation of the project, as well as problems I ran into and how I solved them, can be found in the [Project Writeup](https://github.com/mattgardner96/AC_Project/blob/master/Project%20Writeup.md).

The writeup is pretty verboseâ€”I'm a student, so I'm used to writing these discussions of process and product for everything I make. Linked [here](https://github.com/mattgardner96/AC_Project/blob/master/Project%20Writeup.md).

**Note: the Grove IR Emitter should be connected to header D5 of the Grove Base Shield V2.0 because of my modifications to the library.**
