# AC_Project
Code for my summer A/C Project. It's up and running, so I'm currently writing usage instructions and some project writeup information.

The general project writeup is pretty verboseâ€”I'm a student, so I'm used to writing these discussions of process and product for everything I make. Linked [here](https://github.com/mattgardner96/AC_Project/blob/master/Project%20Writeup.md).
